• Render Date dropdown using the dateArray given in Resources. Render the First date as
selected
• Render strategy cards below date dropdown using strategyArray provided in Resources.
• Cards should be rendered based on selected date
• The card should contain 2 information (Strategy Name and Strategy Count). Strategy Count
represents the number of occurrences of that name. eg: if Bull Call Spread appears 2 times in
the array then its strategy count is 2. If the strategy count is 1 then label should be ‘Strategy’
